# Inventory and Heartbeat

Learn how external systems send inventory data and heartbeat signals to My platform.

## Overview

After [system registration](./registration.md), external systems communicate with My through two mechanisms:

1. **Inventory**: Complete system information snapshot (hardware, software, configuration)
2. **Heartbeat**: Periodic "I'm alive" signal to indicate system is active

Both operations use **HTTP Basic Authentication** with the registered credentials.

## Authentication

### Credentials

Use the credentials obtained during system lifecycle:

- **Username**: `system_key` (received at registration)
- **Password**: `system_secret` (from system creation)

### HTTP Basic Auth

**Header format:**
```
Authorization: Basic base64(system_key:system_secret)
```

**Example:**
```
system_key: NOC-F64B-A989-C9E7-45B9-A55D-59EC-6545-40EE
system_secret: my_a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0.k1l2m3n4o5p6q7r8s9t0u1v2w3x4y5z6a7b8c9d0

Base64 encode: "NOC-F64B-A989-C9E7-45B9-A55D-59EC-6545-40EE:my_a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0.k1l2m3n4o5p6q7r8s9t0u1v2w3x4y5z6a7b8c9d0"

Authorization: Basic bXlfc3lzX2FiYzEyM2RlZjQ1NjpteV9hMWIyYzNkNGU1ZjZnN2g4aTlqMC5rMWwybTNuNG81cDZxN3I4czl0MHUxdjJ3M3g0eTV6NmE3YjhjOWQw
```

**Most HTTP libraries handle this automatically:**
```python
import requests

requests.post(url,
    auth=('NOC-F64B-A989-C9E7-45B9-A55D-59EC-6545-40EE', 'my_a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0.k1l2m3n4o5p6q7r8s9t0u1v2w3x4y5z6a7b8c9d0'),
    json=data
)
```

## Heartbeat

Heartbeat is a simple signal to indicate the system is alive and reachable.

### Purpose

- Detect when systems become inactive
- Trigger alerts for dead systems
- Monitor system reliability

### Endpoint

```
POST https://my.nethesis.it/collect/api/systems/heartbeat
```

:::note
Collect service runs on **/collect** (different from main backend on **/backend**)
:::

### Request

**Headers:**
```
Authorization: Basic <credentials>
Content-Type: application/json
```

**Body:**
```json
{}
```

**Empty JSON object** - no data needed!

### Response

**Success (HTTP 200):**
```json
{
  "code": 200,
  "message": "heartbeat acknowledged",
  "data": {
    "system_key": "NOC-80F8-89A4-40B0-4AE9-A670-7C5F-99B3-F3EA",
    "acknowledged": true,
    "last_heartbeat": "2025-11-07T10:37:27.360343+01:00"
  }
}
```

### Frequency

**Recommended:** Every 5 minutes

**Why 5 minutes?**
- A system stays `active` while its last heartbeat is younger than the platform
  timeout, **20 minutes** by default (`HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT_MINUTES`)
- A 5-minute interval leaves room for three missed beats before the system flips
- Balance between network traffic and responsiveness

### Example Implementation

**Python:**
```python
import requests
import time

COLLECT_URL = "https://my.nethesis.it/collect"
SYSTEM_KEY = "NOC-F64B-A989-C9E7-45B9-A55D-59EC-6545-40EE"
SYSTEM_SECRET = "my_a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0.k1l2m3n4o5p6q7r8s9t0u1v2w3x4y5z6a7b8c9d0"

def send_heartbeat():
    """Send heartbeat to My platform"""
    try:
        response = requests.post(
            f"{COLLECT_URL}/api/systems/heartbeat",
            auth=(SYSTEM_KEY, SYSTEM_SECRET),
            json={},
            timeout=10
        )
        response.raise_for_status()
        print("Heartbeat sent successfully")
        return True
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Heartbeat failed: {e}")
        return False

# Send heartbeat every 5 minutes
while True:
    send_heartbeat()
    time.sleep(300)  # 5 minutes
```

**Bash (cron):**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# /usr/local/bin/my-heartbeat.sh

COLLECT_URL="https://my.nethesis.it/collect"
SYSTEM_KEY="NOC-F64B-A989-C9E7-45B9-A55D-59EC-6545-40EE"
SYSTEM_SECRET="my_a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0.k1l2m3n4o5p6q7r8s9t0u1v2w3x4y5z6a7b8c9d0"

curl -s -X POST "$COLLECT_URL/api/systems/heartbeat" \
  -u "$SYSTEM_KEY:$SYSTEM_SECRET" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}' > /dev/null
```

**Crontab entry (every 5 minutes):**
```
*/5 * * * * /usr/local/bin/my-heartbeat.sh
```

### Heartbeat Status

Systems are classified based on heartbeat:

| Status | Condition | Meaning |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Unknown** | Never sent a heartbeat | Registered but never in contact |
| **Active** | Last heartbeat younger than 20 minutes | System is healthy |
| **Inactive** | Last heartbeat older than 20 minutes | System is not responding |
| **Unregistered** | Gave up its credentials | Terminal, see [Registration](./registration.md#unregistering-a-system) |

:::note Why the status lags
The 20 minutes come from `HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT_MINUTES`, and a cron re-evaluates
every system **every 5 minutes** (`HEARTBEAT_CHECK_INTERVAL_SECONDS`). A silent
system therefore shows up as `inactive` somewhere between 20 and 25 minutes
after its last heartbeat, not exactly at 20. Recovery works the same way in
reverse: the first heartbeat after the outage restores `active` at the next
cron pass, not instantly.
:::

## Inventory

Inventory is a complete snapshot of system configuration and installed software.

### Purpose

- Track system hardware and software
- Detect configuration changes
- Monitor software versions
- Audit system compliance
- Track inventory history

### Endpoint

```
POST https://my.nethesis.it/collect/api/systems/inventory
```

:::note
Same collect service as the heartbeat, under the same **/collect** prefix
:::

### Request

**Headers:**
```
Authorization: Basic <credentials>
Content-Type: application/json
```

### Response

**Success (HTTP 200):**
```json
{
  "code": 200,
  "message": "Inventory received and queued for processing",
  "data": {
    "data_size": 16433,

    "timestamp": "2025-11-07T10:39:05.897352+01:00"
  }
}
```

### Frequency

**Recommended:** Every 6 hours (4 times per day)

**Why 6 hours?**
- Balance between freshness and network/storage load
- Captures daily changes
- Reduces database growth
- Sufficient for most monitoring needs

**Special cases:**
- **After system changes**: Send immediately
- **During updates**: Send before and after
- **On-demand**: Admin can trigger via API

### Inventory Schema

#### Required Fields

**Minimum required data:**
```json
{
  "fqdn": "server.example.com",
  "ipv4_address": "192.168.1.100",
  "os": {
    "name": "NethSec",
    "type": "nethsecurity",
    "family": "OpenWRT",
    "release": {
        "full": "8.6.0-dev+43d54cd33.20251020175318",
        "major": 7
    }
  }
}
```

#### Optional Sections

All other sections are optional but recommended:

- `os`: Operating system information
- `hardware`: Physical/virtual hardware specs
- `network`: Network configuration
- `services`: Installed services and versions
- `features`: Enabled features and capabilities
- `custom`: Any custom data (free-form)

#### Auto-Detection

Some fields are auto-detected by platform:

## Inventory History & Timeline

My retains the full history of inventory changes for each system, allowing you to see how a system evolved over time -- from its first registration to today.

### What is Preserved

- **All changes (diffs)**: Every detected change is stored permanently and never deleted. Each diff records the field that changed, the previous value, and the new value.
- **Inventory snapshots**: Full JSON snapshots are retained with exponential density -- more frequent near the present, progressively sparser for older dates:

| Age | Snapshot frequency |
|-----|--------------------|
| Last 7 days | All snapshots |
| 7 days - 1 month | 1 per day |
| 1 month - 3 months | 1 per week |
| 3 months - 1 year | 1 per month |
| Older than 1 year | 1 per quarter |

:::tip
The **first snapshot ever** received for a system (the baseline) and the **most recent snapshot** (current state) are always preserved regardless of age.
:::

### The Timeline

The timeline shows the complete evolution of a system grouped by date. For each inventory submission that contained changes, you can see:

- When the change occurred
- Which fields changed (path, previous value, new value)
- Severity and category of each change

Since all diffs are kept permanently, the timeline remains fully navigable even for systems registered years ago. You can filter by date range, severity, category, or change type.

### Viewing History

**In Admin Panel:**
1. Navigate to **Systems** > **System Details**
2. Click the **Inventory** tab
3. Use the **Timeline** view for date-grouped change history
4. Use the **History** view for paginated raw snapshots

## Change Detection

My automatically detects changes between inventory snapshots.

### What is Tracked

- Hardware changes (CPU, memory, disk)
- Software version changes
- Service additions/removals
- Network configuration changes
- Feature toggles
- Custom field modifications

### Change Categories

Changes are categorized by type:

- **OS**: Operating system and kernel
- **Hardware**: Physical/virtual hardware
- **Network**: Network interfaces and configuration
- **Features**: Enabled features and capabilities
- **Services**: Installed services
- **System**: General system settings

### Change Severity

Each change has a severity level:

- **Critical**: Requires immediate attention (e.g., hardware failure)
- **High**: Important changes (e.g., OS upgrade)
- **Medium**: Notable changes (e.g., service update)
- **Low**: Minor changes (e.g., metrics update)

### Viewing Changes

**In Admin Panel:**
1. Navigate to **Systems** > **System Details**
2. Click **Inventory** tab
3. View **Changes** section
4. See detailed diff between versions

**Change types:**
- **Create**: New field added
- **Update**: Field value changed
- **Delete**: Field removed

**Example change log:**
```
[2025-11-06 10:30] OS Version updated
  - Old: Rocky Linux 9.2
  - New: Rocky Linux 9.3
  - Severity: High
  - Category: OS

[2025-11-06 10:30] Nginx version updated
  - Old: 1.23.0
  - New: 1.24.0
  - Severity: Medium
  - Category: Services

[2025-11-06 10:30] New feature enabled: Docker
  - Value: 24.0.7
  - Severity: Medium
  - Category: Features
```

## Monitoring in Admin Panel

### Real-time Status

**Dashboard view** (see [Dashboard](../features/dashboard.md)):
- Total systems, with badges for active, inactive and pending that open the list already filtered
- Open alerts, with badges by severity

**System list:**
- Heartbeat status indicator
- Last heartbeat time
- Last inventory time
- Change notifications

### Alerts (if configured)

Automatic alerts for:
- System becomes inactive (no heartbeat for more than 20 minutes)
- Critical changes detected in inventory
- New system registered
- System version mismatch
- Security vulnerabilities detected

:::note
The built-in `LinkFailed` alert is raised by Collect for every system already
in `inactive` state, so it follows the same `HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT_MINUTES` (20 by
default). Collect refreshes it every 5 minutes while the system stays inactive,
and the alert carries a TTL of twice that interval, so it can remain visible for
up to 10 minutes after the heartbeat resumes. That deliberate delay keeps the
alert from flapping when heartbeats arrive right around the timeout.
:::

### System Health

Each processed inventory carries a **health score** derived from the changes detected in it. It starts at 100 and loses points per diff, by severity:

| Severity | Points deducted |
|----------|-----------------|
| Critical | 10 |
| High | 5 |
| Medium | 2 |
| Low | 1 |

The score is floored at 0, and an inventory with no changes scores 100. It measures how disruptive the last set of changes was -- not heartbeat uptime or how fresh the inventory is.

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Fails (HTTP 401)

**Problem:** "Invalid system credentials" or "Unauthorized"

**Solutions:**
1. Verify credentials are correct:
   ```bash
   echo -n "system_key:system_secret" | base64
   ```
2. Check for extra spaces in credentials
3. Ensure system is registered
4. Verify secret wasn't regenerated
5. Test with curl:
   ```bash
   curl -v -u "system_key:system_secret" \
     https://my.nethesis.it/collect/api/systems/heartbeat \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{}'
   ```

### Connection Timeout

**Problem:** Request times out, no response

**Solutions:**
1. Check network connectivity:
   ```bash
   ping my.nethesis.it
   ```
2. Verify HTTPS is reachable:
   ```bash
   curl -sI https://my.nethesis.it/collect/api/systems/heartbeat
   ```
3. Check firewall rules (allow outbound HTTPS to my.nethesis.it)
4. Verify DNS resolution
5. Test from different network

### Inventory Not Updating

**Problem:** Inventory sent successfully but not visible in admin panel

**Solutions:**
1. Wait 60 seconds and refresh (cache propagation)
2. Verify you're viewing the correct system
3. Check inventory was sent to the correct endpoint (`/collect/api/systems/inventory`)
4. Verify system is not deleted
5. Check system logs for errors

### Heartbeat Shows as "Dead"

**Problem:** System shows red/dead status despite sending heartbeat

**Solutions:**
1. Check heartbeat frequency (must be well under the 20-minute timeout)
2. Verify heartbeat is reaching platform:
   ```bash
   curl -v https://my.nethesis.it/collect/api/systems/heartbeat \
     -u "key:secret" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}'
   ```
3. Check system time is synchronized (NTP)
4. Verify no clock drift
5. Review collect service logs (admin only)

### Changes Not Detected

**Problem:** Inventory sent but no changes shown

**Solutions:**
1. Verify actual data changed between inventories
2. Check that changed fields are supported
3. Small numerical changes may not trigger detection
4. Custom fields are tracked for changes
5. Wait for next inventory and compare

## Best Practices

### Heartbeat

- Send every 5 minutes consistently
- Use scheduled task (cron, systemd timer)
- Log heartbeat failures for debugging
- Implement retry logic (exponential backoff)
- Monitor heartbeat success rate

### Inventory

- Send complete inventory every time
- Don't send partial updates
- Include all relevant data
- Use consistent field names
- Validate JSON before sending
- Send immediately after significant changes

### Error Handling

- Implement retry logic for network failures
- Log all errors with context
- Don't retry authentication errors (401)
- Use exponential backoff for retries
- Alert on repeated failures

### Security

- Store credentials securely
- Never log credentials
- Use HTTPS only
- Verify SSL certificates
- Monitor for authentication failures

:::warning
There is no credential rotation for a registered system: `Regenerate Secret` is refused once `registered_at` is set. Treat the `system_secret` as permanent for the life of the system, and replace the system itself if it is ever compromised.
:::

### Performance

- Compress large inventories
- Batch data collection
- Avoid unnecessary inventory sends
- Use efficient data structures
- Monitor network bandwidth
