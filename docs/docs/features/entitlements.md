# Add-ons

Granular add-on licensing for systems: firewall services and per-application modules, purchased on NethShop and enforced in real time. Each add-on is backed by an **entitlement** — a license that grants one add-on to one system.

## Overview

Two kinds of add-on exist:

- **Service** — a NethSecurity firewall add-on, granted system-wide (e.g. *Advanced Threat Shield*, *High Availability*, *Sandbox*)
- **Module** — an add-on for a **single application instance** of a NethServer 8 cluster (e.g. the *Chat* module for `nethvoice1`, but not for `nethvoice2`)

Add-ons are bought on **NethShop** and appear on the system automatically once the subscription is active. Renewals extend the expiry in place; cancelling the subscription revokes the grant. The appliance features validate their license in real time against My Nethesis (`/auth`): without an active add-on the feature is not served.

## The Add-ons tab

Every system whose type is known (NethSecurity or NethServer 8) shows an **Add-ons** tab:

- On a **firewall** the table lists the available services: purchased ones show the payment reference, validity, next renewal and — where the product has tiers — the purchased **tier** (e.g. *31 - 60 device*); the others offer **Buy on NethShop**.
- On a **cluster** the table has two levels: the application instances found on the system (from the inventory) and, under each instance, the modules available for that application — purchased or buyable per instance.

Each purchased add-on also shows **who bought it** (*Purchased by*), within the limits of your hierarchy: a buyer in your organizations is named, one that sits above you or in another branch is shown as *purchased by another organization*, and an add-on carried over from the legacy migration — whose buyer was never a My Nethesis user — reads *migrated, buyer not recorded*.

The **Buy on NethShop** button opens the shop with the system (and application instance) pre-selected, so the purchase is bound to the right target with no manual input.

## Finding the systems that hold an add-on

The systems list carries an **Add-on** filter: pick one or more add-ons to keep
only the systems that hold them. The menu offers the add-ons present on your own
systems, and the match counts only grants that are valid at that moment, so an
expired or cancelled add-on leaves the system out. The filter also applies to the
CSV and PDF export, which therefore carries the same rows as the list on screen.
See [Systems Management](../systems/management.md#filtering-and-search).

## Roles and permissions

| Capability | Who |
|---|---|
| See add-ons and expirations (`read:entitlements`) | All user roles, within their hierarchy |
| Buy on NethShop / cancel a subscription (`manage:entitlements`) | Admin, Backoffice — and Nethesis staff, across the whole fleet |
| Manage the catalog, manual grants, fleet-wide view | Owner organization (Nethesis) |

Distributors and resellers cannot self-activate add-ons: everything flows through the shop.

## Add-ons catalog (Nethesis)

The **Add-ons** entry in the side menu is available to everyone holding the `read:entitlements` permission, but the **Configuration** tab with the catalog of add-on types is reserved to the Owner organization. Creating a type takes a kind (Service or Module), the target application for modules (the id is composed automatically, e.g. `nethvoice` + `chat` → `nethvoice-chat`), a display name and a description.

Two switches govern whether a type can be bought:

- **On sale** — when off, the add-on is still shown on the systems that hold it (so an existing base can be mapped) but the **Buy** button is hidden: nobody can purchase it any more. Useful for a private or discontinued add-on. Editable by the Owner organization.
- **Availability rules** — optional restrictions that limit a type to specific hierarchy roles or organizations. A type with no rules is available to everyone (subject to the *On sale* switch).

Deleting a type is refused while grants reference it — revoked and expired ones included, since they are kept for audit. The catalog list flags those types as *in use*, so the delete action is disabled instead of failing.

## Reporting

`GET /backend/api/entitlements/grants` (with filters by entitlement, organization, source, active state and expiry window) and `GET /backend/api/entitlements/stats` provide the licensing report: buyers see their own hierarchy — every add-on with its expiry and renewal — while the Owner organization sees the whole fleet.

The **Add-ons** page shows the same data as a dashboard, on the **Report** tab: lifecycle counters, expiring add-ons, the per-add-on breakdown, the renewal distribution and the 12-month activation trend (`GET /backend/api/entitlements/report`, plus the paginated `/report/organizations` and `/report/tiers`). Every aggregate follows the same visibility as the grants list — a distributor or reseller sees its own organizations, a customer only its own systems, the Owner organization the whole fleet. The per-organization table is omitted for customers, which have nothing below them.

## For developers

- Grants live in `system_entitlements` (one row per system + entitlement + scope; renewals update `valid_until` in place, revocations keep the row for audit). The purchase snapshot (`purchased_by`) and the tier (`variant`) are stored alongside, display-only.
- Enforcement is served by collect: `GET /auth/service/<id>[?scope=<instance>]` with the system's Basic credentials returns `200` with an active grant, `403` without. Legacy wire ids (`ng-*`) are resolved through the catalog `legacy_alias`, so the appliance feeds keep calling the historical paths unchanged.
- The shop activates and renews grants through `POST /backend/api/entitlements/activate` (idempotent, addressed by `system_key`) and revokes them with `POST /backend/api/entitlements/deactivate`.
- `GET /backend/api/systems` takes a repeatable `addon=<catalog id>` filter (several ids match any of them) and, with `include_addons=true`, adds to every system the `addons` list of the catalog ids it currently holds. The list is opt-in because it costs one extra query per page, which a bulk read has no use for. The choices for the filter come from `GET /backend/api/filters/systems`, which returns the add-ons present in the caller's hierarchy as `{id, display_name}` pairs; `GET /backend/api/entitlements/catalog` resolves any id to its name.
