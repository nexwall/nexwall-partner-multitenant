# Welcome to My Nethesis

**My Nethesis** is a centralized management platform that provides authentication, hierarchical organization management, system monitoring, and role-based access control.

## Key Features

- **Centralized Authentication** using Logto as Identity Provider
- **Hierarchical Organization Management** (Owner, Distributor, Reseller, Customer)
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** with dual-role system
- **System Monitoring** with real-time inventory and heartbeat tracking
- **Change Detection** with automatic diff analysis and severity levels
- **User Self-Service** with avatar management, profile editing, and password change
- **Data Export** in CSV and PDF formats
- **Organization Rebranding** with custom logos, favicons, and backgrounds per product
- **Application Management** with organization assignment

## Business Hierarchy

```
Owner (Nethesis)
    ↓
Distributors
    ↓
Resellers
    ↓
Customers
```

Each level manages only their downstream organizations.

## Dual-Role System

**Organization Roles** (business hierarchy): Owner, Distributor, Reseller, Customer. Every member of the Owner organization (Nethesis) has global visibility on all companies, systems and users.

**User Roles** (technical capabilities): Admin, Backoffice, Support, Reader for partner organizations, plus Staff, reserved to the Owner organization

Effective permissions = Organization Role + User Role
