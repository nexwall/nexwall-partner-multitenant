# Account Settings

Manage your language, profile, avatar, password, API keys and impersonation consent.

## Overview

The Account page is reached from the user menu in the top-right corner. It is made of these sections:

- **General settings** -- interface language
- **Profile** -- your personal information
- **Avatar** -- your profile picture
- **Change password** -- credential update
- **API keys** -- credentials for programmatic access
- **Impersonation consent** -- whether administrators may act as you

## General Settings

### Language Selection

The interface is available in:

- **English** (default)
- **Italian**

On first sign-in the language follows your browser; afterwards it follows your saved preference. To change it:

1. Go to **Account**
2. Find the **Language** setting
3. Pick your language

The change applies to the whole interface immediately, and is remembered for your next sessions.

## Profile Management

### Edit Your Profile

1. Go to **Account**
2. In the **Profile** section update:
   - **Name**: your display name across the platform
   - **Email**: your email address, which is also your username
   - **Phone number**: optional
3. Click **Save profile**

:::note
A new email address is not applied right away: a verification code is sent to it, and the change takes effect only once you enter that code. Your current address stays active until then. The code expires after 10 minutes, and you can request a new one from the same dialog.
:::

## Avatar Management

Your avatar appears throughout the platform next to your name, in comments and in user lists.

### Upload an Avatar

1. Go to **Account**
2. Click the avatar area or the **Upload** button
3. Pick an image: PNG, JPEG or WebP, at most **500 KB** and **4096x4096** pixels
4. The image is scaled to fit within 256x256, converted to PNG and applied immediately

### Default Avatar

With no avatar set, the interface shows your initials on a colored circle, derived from your display name.

### Delete Your Avatar

1. Go to **Account**
2. Click **Delete** on your current avatar
3. The initials placeholder is restored

### Public URL

Your avatar is reachable without authentication at `/backend/api/public/users/{user_id}/avatar`.

For the full details, see [Avatar Management](../features/avatar.md).

## Password Change

1. Go to **Account**
2. In the **Change password** section enter:
   - **Current password**
   - **New password**
   - **Confirm password**
3. Click **Save**

:::warning
The new password must satisfy the platform policy: at least **12 characters**, with an uppercase letter, a lowercase letter, a digit and a special character. See [Password Requirements](./authentication.md#password-requirements).
:::

## API Keys

The Account page includes an **API Keys** section where you can create and revoke personal keys for programmatic access from external applications and scripts. For full details, see [API Keys](./api-keys.md).

## Impersonation Consent

The **Impersonation** section controls whether Owner-organization administrators can temporarily use the platform as you. For how impersonation works, see [Impersonation](../platform/impersonation.md).

:::note
Consent is optional and always yours to revoke. With consent revoked, nobody can start a session as you.

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot Save Profile Changes

**Problem:** Changes are not saved after clicking Save

**Solutions:**
- Ensure all required fields are filled in
- Check that your email address is valid
- Try refreshing the page and making the changes again
- If changing email, enter the verification code sent to the new address; if it expired, request a new one

### Avatar Upload Fails

**Problem:** Avatar does not upload or shows an error

**Solutions:**
- Verify the file is in a supported format (PNG, JPEG or WebP)
- Check that the file size is under 500 KB
- Ensure the image dimensions do not exceed 4096x4096 pixels
- Try a different image file

### Password Change Fails

**Problem:** Cannot change password

**Solutions:**
- Verify your current password is correct
- Ensure the new password meets every requirement: 12+ characters, uppercase, lowercase, digit, special character, no more than 3 identical characters in a row and no common weak pattern
- Make sure the new password and its confirmation match
- If you forgot your current password, use the "Forgot your password?" link on the login page instead
