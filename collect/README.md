# Collect - System Inventory Collection Service

High-performance inventory collection service that handles thousands of systems reporting their inventory data every minute with real-time change detection and notifications.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.24+
- PostgreSQL 15+
- Redis 7+
- Docker/Podman

### Setup

> **Note:** Collect shares the same PostgreSQL and Redis containers with the backend.
> If you already started them with `cd backend && make dev-up`, you can skip `make dev-up` here.

```bash
# Setup development environment
make dev-setup

# Start PostgreSQL and Redis containers (skip if already running from backend)
make dev-up

# Start the application (port 8081)
make run

# Stop PostgreSQL and Redis when done
make dev-down
```

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# Postgres URL
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://noc_user:noc_password@localhost:5432/noc?sslmode=disable

# Redis Configuration
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
REDIS_DB=1
REDIS_PASSWORD=
# Note: REDIS_PASSWORD can be empty for Redis without authentication
```

### Optional Environment Variables
```bash
LISTEN_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1:8081
API_MAX_REQUEST_SIZE=10MB
HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT_MINUTES=20
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

## Architecture

### Inventory Processing Flow

**1. Data Collection**
- Systems POST inventory data to `/api/systems/inventory`
- HTTP Basic Auth (`system_id:system_secret`)
- Data queued in `collect:inventory`

**2. Inventory Processing**
- **Inventory Worker** processes batches, stores in `inventory_records`
- SHA-256 deduplication prevents duplicate processing
- Triggers diff computation for systems with previous records

**3. Change Detection**
- **Diff Worker** computes JSON diffs between current and previous inventory
- Categorizes changes (OS, hardware, network, features)
- Stores results in `inventory_diffs` with severity levels

**4. Notifications**
- **Notification Worker** processes significant changes
- Generates alerts based on configurable rules
- Stores notifications in `inventory_alerts`

**5. Retry & Cleanup**
- **Delayed Message Worker** handles failed jobs with exponential backoff
- **Cleanup Worker** applies exponential retention to `inventory_records` (see below); `inventory_diffs` are never deleted
- **Queue Monitor Worker** tracks system health and performance

**6. Heartbeat Monitoring**
- `unknown` → `active` happens inline in the **Heartbeat Worker** (same statement as the heartbeat upsert), so a system just registered turns `active` within seconds of its first heartbeat
- **Heartbeat Monitor Cron** handles the freshness-based transitions:
  - `inactive` → `active` when a fresh heartbeat arrives (within `HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT_MINUTES`); this recovery path also resolves the firing `LinkFailed` alert
  - `active` → `inactive` when the heartbeat is stale (older than `HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT_MINUTES`)
  - `unknown` → `active` as a safety net for the inline flip
- Configurable timeout via `HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT_MINUTES` (default: 20 minutes)

**7. LinkFailed Synchronization**
- **LinkFailed Monitor Cron** runs every 5 minutes
- Fires the internal `LinkFailed` alert for inactive, non-deleted, non-suspended systems after `HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT_MINUTES` (20 minutes by default); systems under a suspended organization are excluded too
- On recovery (`inactive` → `active`) the heartbeat monitor posts an explicit resolve with the same fingerprint, so Alertmanager clears the alert immediately instead of waiting for the TTL; the 10 minute TTL from the last refresh remains a backstop if a resolve is ever missed
- Reuses the same server-side label enrichment as the Mimir proxy so internal alerts carry the same authoritative system and organization labels

**8. Active alerts totals refresh**
- **Alerts Totals Refresher Cron** runs every 60 seconds
- Fans out to Mimir Alertmanager (one `GET /alertmanager/api/v2/alerts` per tenant, bounded concurrency 50, 30s timeout) and tallies active alerts by severity and muted state for every organization in `unified_organizations`
- Writes the result into `alerts_totals_by_org` via a single multi-VALUES `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`, so the backend `/api/alerts/totals` endpoint serves the dashboard counters with a single SQL `SUM` (typically <10ms) instead of paying the per-tenant fan-out on every user request
- Per-tenant failures are aggregated and surfaced as a single warn line per cycle with `failures`, `orgs_total`, and a `sample_error` (avoids flooding the log when Mimir is unreachable)
- A tenant that fails this cycle keeps its previous counts in the table — its row is not refreshed until a subsequent cycle succeeds; the backend exposes `MIN(updated_at)` as a `stale data` warning to the caller when the freshest row is older than 5 minutes

### Queue Architecture
- `collect:inventory` → Raw inventory data
- `collect:processing` → Diff computation jobs
- `collect:notifications` → Alert notifications
- `{queue}:delayed` → Failed jobs with retry delays
- `{queue}:dead` → Jobs that exceeded max retry attempts

### Data Retention Policy

**`inventory_diffs`** are never deleted. They are the source of truth for the timeline feature (`/inventory/timeline`) and are self-contained (each diff stores `field_path`, `previous_value`, `current_value`).

**`inventory_records`** (full JSON snapshots) use exponential retention — more frequent near the present, progressively sparser further back:

| Age | Retention |
|-----|-----------|
| Last 7 days | All records preserved |
| 7 days – 1 month | 1 per day |
| 1 month – 3 months | 1 per week |
| 3 months – 1 year | 1 per month |
| Older than 1 year | 1 per quarter |

The **first** record per system (inventory baseline) and the **latest** record (current state, used by `/inventory/latest`) are always preserved regardless of age.

# Submit heartbeat (requires system credentials from backend API)
# Authentication via HTTP Basic Auth: system_key:system_secret
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/systems/heartbeat \
  -u "NOC-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX:your_system_secret"

# Submit inventory (requires system credentials from backend API)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/systems/inventory \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -u "system_key:system_secret" \
  -d '{"system_id": "test", "timestamp": "2025-07-13T10:00:00Z", "data": {"os": {"name": "TestOS"}}}'

# Upload a configuration backup (streams the file body; GPG encryption is
# up to the appliance). X-Filename is the user-facing name shown in the UI.
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/systems/backups \
  -u "system_key:system_secret" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" \
  -H "X-Filename: dump.json.gz.gpg" \
  --data-binary @/path/to/backup.gpg
```

### Appliance integration (NS8 / NethSecurity)

Each authenticated system owns a prefix in the backup bucket
(`{org_id}/{system_key}/...`) and the three endpoints below are all the
appliance needs. Auth is always HTTP Basic with the system_key and the
system_secret returned at registration:

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `POST /api/systems/backups`   | Stream a new backup. 201 on success with `{id, sha256, size, uploaded_at}` in the body. |
| `GET /api/systems/backups`    | List own backups with metadata. |
| `GET /api/systems/backups/:id` | Download a stored backup for restore. |

Retention is enforced server-side: after each upload the oldest entries
beyond `BACKUP_MAX_PER_SYSTEM` or `BACKUP_MAX_SIZE_PER_SYSTEM` are
pruned. Client-side dedup via local MD5 is still useful — if the hash
of the just-encrypted blob equals the one from the previous run the
appliance can skip the upload entirely.

### Backup storage

Backup objects are stored on any S3-compatible bucket. In production
the project targets DigitalOcean Spaces (the same account that backs
Mimir); for local development point the `BACKUP_S3_*` env vars at your
preferred emulator (MinIO, Garage, LocalStack, …) or at a dedicated dev
bucket on your S3 provider of choice. Backend and collect must share
the same bucket — collect writes, backend reads and issues presigned
download URLs.

**Separate credentials (optional).** Nothing in the code forces backend
and collect to share the same `S3_ACCESS_KEY` / `S3_SECRET_KEY`.
If your S3 provider supports per-key policies (AWS S3 IAM, Cloudflare
R2 scoped tokens, MinIO user policies), issue two keys: one for
**collect** scoped to `PutObject`/`CopyObject`/`DeleteObject`/
`ListObjectsV2`/`HeadObject` on the bucket prefix, and one for
**backend** scoped to `GetObject`/`ListObjectsV2`/`HeadObject`/
`DeleteObject`. Then set a different `S3_ACCESS_KEY` /
`S3_SECRET_KEY` pair on each service. This contains blast
radius if one component is ever compromised.

Object keys follow `{org_id}/{system_key}/{backup_id}.{ext}` — the
user-facing `system_key` (`NETH-…`) is preferred over the internal UUID
so operators browsing a raw bucket listing can recognise each system at
a glance. Per-object
metadata is stored as standard `x-amz-meta-*` headers:

| Header                   | Source                                                               |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `x-amz-meta-sha256`      | Computed by collect via streaming tee at ingest                      |
| `x-amz-meta-filename`    | From the appliance request header `X-Filename` (user-facing name)    |
| `x-amz-meta-uploader-ip` | Client IP observed by collect                                        |

### Testing the backup round-trip end-to-end

Any S3-compatible bucket works. Provision one on your preferred
provider (DigitalOcean Spaces, Cloudflare R2, AWS S3, a self-hosted
MinIO/Garage, …), issue an access key pair scoped to that bucket, and
set the values in `backend/.env` and `collect/.env`:

```
S3_ENDPOINT=...        # e.g. https://ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com
BACKUP_S3_REGION=ams3         # DO Spaces region code; any non-empty value works for MinIO/Garage
BACKUP_S3_BUCKET=my-backups-dev
S3_ACCESS_KEY=...
S3_SECRET_KEY=...
BACKUP_S3_USE_PATH_STYLE=false   # set to true only for MinIO/Garage
```

Restart backend and collect, then simulate an appliance upload — the
GPG pipeline below matches exactly what NS8's `send-cluster-backup`
and NethSecurity's `send-backup` produce today:

```bash
# Prepare a fake GPG-encrypted blob
echo '{"simulation": true}' | gzip > /tmp/dump.json.gz
gpg --batch --yes -c --pinentry-mode loopback --cipher-algo AES256 \
    --passphrase-fd 0 /tmp/dump.json.gz <<< "local-dev-passphrase"

# Upload as an authenticated appliance
curl --user "$SYSTEM_KEY:$SYSTEM_SECRET" \
     -H "X-Filename: dump.json.gz.gpg" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" \
     --data-binary @/tmp/dump.json.gz.gpg \
     http://localhost:8081/api/systems/backups
```

Verify the object shows up under `{org_id}/{system_key}/<uuidv7>.gpg`
in the bucket (via the provider's console or the AWS CLI).

## Machine-scoped Alertmanager access

The Mimir Alertmanager endpoints (`/services/mimir/alertmanager/api/v2/*`) implement strict per-machine scoping to ensure systems can only access their own alerts and silences.

### How scoping works

Each system (identified by `system_key`) is automatically restricted to see and manage only its own data:

- **GET /alerts**: The proxy injects a `system_key` filter into the query, limiting results to this system's alerts
- **POST /alerts**: The `system_key`, `system_id`, and `organization_id` labels are injected and override any client values
- **GET /silences**: The proxy injects a `system_key` filter to scope results to this system's silences
- **POST /silences**: The proxy injects a `system_key` matcher, overwriting any client-supplied `system_key` matcher. This ensures the silence can only target this system's alerts
- **GET /silences/{id}**: The proxy fetches the silence from Mimir and verifies it contains an exact `system_key` matcher matching this system. Denies access (403) if the silence does not belong to this system
- **DELETE /silences/{id}**: Same ownership verification as GET, then deletes only if verified

### Security properties

- Systems cannot view, create, or modify silences for other systems
- Silence matchers cannot be bypassed — a `system_key` matcher is always enforced server-side
- The `system_key` label in alerts is always server-sourced (injected via `injectLabels` in `mimir.go`), never trusted from client input
- Failed ownership checks are logged with system and path details for audit purposes

## Alert annotation templating

Alert annotations support Go text/template syntax. When alerts are posted to `/api/services/mimir/alertmanager/api/v2/alerts`, the proxy processes any template expressions in annotation values, substituting alert labels.

### Template syntax

Use standard Go template syntax with alert labels as data:

```json
{
  "labels": {
    "severity": "critical",
    "alertname": "DiskFull",
    "system_key": "SYS-001"
  },
  "annotations": {
    "summary": "Alert {{.alertname}} has severity {{.severity}}",
    "description": "System: {{.system_key}}"
  }
}
```

Result after templating:
```json
{
  "annotations": {
    "summary": "Alert DiskFull has severity critical",
    "description": "System: SYS-001"
  }
}
```

### Behavior

- Only annotations containing `{{` are processed
- Labels are passed as template data (accessible via `.fieldname`)
- Non-existent labels render as `<no value>`
- Invalid template syntax is logged as a warning; the annotation remains unchanged
- Non-string annotation values are preserved as-is
- Static annotations (without template syntax) pass through unchanged

## Feed authorization (`/auth`)

The NethSecurity enterprise feeds (distfeed, ns-signatures-proxy, blacklists) forward-auth the appliance's `system_key:system_secret` Basic credentials against `/api/auth`. The endpoints replace the legacy my `/auth` with the same wire semantics:

- `GET /api/auth` — `200` when the credentials belong to a registered, non-suspended system (valid subscription); `401` otherwise
- `GET /api/auth/service/{id}` — `200` when the system holds an **active entitlement** for `{id}` (from `system_entitlements`: not revoked, not expired); `403` otherwise. The id may be the canonical catalog id (e.g. `nsec-blacklist`) or the legacy wire alias the feeds still call (e.g. `ng-blacklist`), resolved through `entitlement_catalog.legacy_alias`. The optional `?scope=<application-instance>` query (e.g. `?scope=nethvoice1`) also matches grants narrowed to that instance; a system-wide grant covers every instance
- `GET /api/auth/product/{name}` — `200` for any valid system (product-level enforcement is deferred)

Entitlements are managed by the backend (`/api/systems/:id/entitlements`, `/api/entitlements/*`) and activated by the NethShop purchase flow; collect only reads them, with no extra caching layer, so grants and revocations take effect on the next feed check.
