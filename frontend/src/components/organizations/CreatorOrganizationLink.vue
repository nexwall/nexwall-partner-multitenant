/**
 * The organization of a creator snapshot, rendered as a link to its detail page.
 *
 * The link keeps the muted colour of the creator line it sits in and only
 * asserts itself on hover, so a table full of creators does not read as a wall
 * of links. Falls back to plain text when the organization has no detail page
 * (Owner, deleted, not synced yet) and when the current user could not open it.
 * The user's own organization is always open to it.
 *
 * The permission gate bites hardest here: a creator is frequently an upper
 * tier, so a customer reading "On behalf of <its distributor>" would otherwise
 * be offered a page the API refuses it.
