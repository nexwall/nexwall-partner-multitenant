/**

 * already running, which is what makes local iteration quick. The catch: a
 * long-running Vite server that hot-reloaded through an edit to the app entry
 * (`main.ts`) can end up in a broken state where component-library refs come
 * back undefined — dropdowns and side drawers stop opening, while navigation
 * and the rest of the page look perfectly healthy. Every symptom then reads as
 * a product bug, and a suite that trusts it reports nonsense.
 *
 * So open one. A drawer that appears is the only evidence that means anything
 * here, and it costs one page load: watching the console for the Vue "Missing
 * ref owner context" warnings the broken state emits proves nothing on a page
 * that mounts no such component, and needs a sleep to do even that.
 *
 * Declared after the sign-in loop so the owner's session already exists.
