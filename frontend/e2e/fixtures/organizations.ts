 * fixture, so everything they create is named under one reserved prefix and
 * nothing outside it is ever touched. Two safeguards:
 *
 * - every name starts with `e2e-`, and `destroyE2eOrganization` refuses to
 *   delete anything that does not;
 * - `sweepE2eOrganizations` clears leftovers from an earlier run that crashed
 *   before its own teardown, so a failed run never poisons the next one.
