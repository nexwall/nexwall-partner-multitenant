 * Post-deploy smoke tests against a deployed environment.
 *
 * These catch the one class of failure the full-stack job structurally cannot
 * see: the stack it tests is built by compose from this checkout, with its own
 * configuration, so a wrong environment variable in `render.yaml`, a missing
 * Logto redirect URI, a proxy route that differs from `nginx.conf.local` or a
 * stale image tag are all invisible there and fatal here.
 *
 * Read-only by construction. The target shares a database and a Logto tenant
 * with real users, so nothing here creates, edits or deletes anything — that
 * is what the `fullstack` project is for, against a local stack.
 *
 * Credentials come from the environment rather than the apitool registry: the
 * registry describes the local fixture, while this signs in as one dedicated
 * account provisioned in the deployed environment's tenant.
 *
 *   npm run test:e2e:smoke
 *
 * The target is `playwright.config.smoke.ts`'s default, QA, unless
 * E2E_SMOKE_BASE_URL says otherwise. Credentials come from the environment or
 * from `frontend/.env.e2e`.
