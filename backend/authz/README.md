# Authorization regression suite

`my` is a maze of organization roles, technical roles, hierarchy scope and
credential types. This suite exists so that no change can quietly open a hole in
it. It provisions a real hierarchy through the public API, mints a real token per
persona via the full Logto OIDC flow, then fires every endpoint as every persona
and asserts what each one may and may not do.

```bash
cd backend
make apitool
./apitool authz provision     # create the fixture (idempotent)
./apitool authz personas      # verify tokens carry what config.yml promises
./apitool authz run           # all four layers → authz-report.json, exit 1 on failure
./apitool authz coverage      # every route has a declared intent?
./apitool authz teardown --yes
```

Useful flags: `--layer=gate|scope|apps|special`, `--filter=<substring>`,
`--personas=d1r1-admin,owner`, `--verbose`, `--idp-probe`, `--report=<path>`.

It refuses to run against anything but a local backend. It creates organizations
and users and fires destructive verbs, so pointing it at QA or production would
pollute real data. `--i-know-this-is-not-local` overrides, deliberately verbose.

## The one rule that keeps this honest

**Expectations are hand-written from intent, never read off the code.**

`routes.yml` says what each endpoint *should* require, decided from
`sync/configs/config.yml` (the role→permission vocabulary `sync` pushes to
Logto), from the documented product behaviour, and from what the endpoint does.
It is never derived from the middleware chain in `main.go`. If the two disagree,
that disagreement is the finding — which is exactly what happened on the first
run. Copying the wiring into the spec would turn the suite into a tautology that
passes no matter how wrong the code is.

Where the real model departs from the declared one, the departure is written down
in `model.yml` with the code that causes it and what should change. Reviewed
exception, not silent adjustment.

## The four layers

| Layer | Question | Checks |
|---|---|---|
| `gate` | May this persona CALL this endpoint? | 170 routes × 14 matrix personas + anonymous |
| `scope` | May it reach THIS OBJECT through it? | hand-written cross-organization scenarios |
| `apps` | Which third-party apps is it offered? | 4 apps × 21 personas, portal vs `access_control` |
| `special` | Rules enforced by middleware or credential type | self-modification, API key masks, impersonation |

### gate — non-destructive by construction

Path parameters are filled with an id that matches nothing and write verbs get a
body that cannot validate, so an authorized call lands on 404/400 *after* the
gate ran. Nothing real is ever touched, which is what makes the matrix safe to
re-run on every change. How a response is read:

| Response | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `403 "insufficient permissions"` | the RBAC middleware refused — a route-level gate |
| `403` anything else | a handler refused — deeper, object-level |
| `404` / `400` | the gate passed; the object or the body did not |
| `2xx` | the gate passed |
| `404 "api not found"` | no endpoint matched — never a pass, the spec path is wrong |

A persona that should be blocked but gets 404 means the route has no gate for it:
the request reached the handler. Whether data actually leaks is then the scope
layer's question.

Verdicts: **FAIL-OPEN** (should have been blocked, was not — the class that leaks
data), **FAIL-CLOSED** (entitled but blocked — a broken promise, not a leak),
**REVIEW** (a human call: a 5xx hiding the answer, or a refusal from an
unexpected place). REVIEW alone does not fail the run; either FAIL does.

### scope — where isolation is actually proved

The fixture has siblings and two branches, because isolation can only be shown
against an organization at the same level on the other side of the tree:

```
owner ── d1 ── d1r1 ── d1r1c1, d1r1c2
         │     └ d1r2 ── d1r2c1
         └ d2 ── d2r1 ── d2r1c1
```

`created_by` decides the hierarchy: organization scope walks
`custom_data.createdBy`, so every org is created *by a user of its intended
parent*. Creating everything as the owner would produce a flat tree and the whole
layer would prove nothing.

`expect: denied` accepts 403 or 404 — hiding existence is a legitimate refusal.
`must_not_contain` catches leakage through lists, aggregates, filters and exports
and runs even on a 200. Matching is by token boundary, not substring: the fixture
names nest on purpose (`authz-d1r1` is a prefix of `authz-d1r1c1`), and plain
substring matching reports a customer's own name as its parent leaking.

## What CI checks

`ci-main.yml` runs `./apitool authz coverage` on every push and pull request.
That one subcommand is offline — it reads `main.go`, the spec and the role
vocabulary, needs no tenant and no running backend — so it can gate every
branch. It fails on a route with no declared intent and on a fixture user whose
role no config defines, which is how a role added here without a matching
definition in `sync/configs/config.yml` gets caught at once instead of days
later. The vocabulary it reads is `sync/configs/config.ci.yml`, the only
tracked config.

Everything else — `personas`, `run` — needs a provisioned tenant and a local
backend, and stays a local gate.

## Adding an endpoint

`./apitool authz coverage` fails when `main.go` registers a route that
`routes.yml` does not mention, so a new endpoint cannot ship without a declared
intent. Add an entry, decide `intent` from the permission vocabulary rather than
from the middleware you just wrote, and give the probe whatever it needs
(`ids`, `body`, `query`) to land on the authorization decision instead of on a
validation error. If the endpoint is object-scoped by design, say so with
`object_scoped: true` and add a scope scenario — that is where its real guarantee
lives.

Available placeholders in `scenarios.yml`, `special.yml` and route
`query`/`body`/`ids`: `{org:KEY}`, `{org_name:KEY}`, `{user:KEY}`,
`{user_email:KEY}`, `{system:KEY}`, `{system_name:KEY}`, `{my_org}`,
`{my_user}`, `{bogus}`.

## What the suite cannot reach

- **Owner-organization personas beyond `owner` and `owner-staff`.** The matrix
  covers both roles that can exist there: the bootstrap `owner` (Owner user
  role, seeded by `sync init` and never assignable) and a provisioned Staff
  user. Nothing else can exist by construction — the API pairs roles and
  organization fail-closed (only Staff inside the Owner org, never outside,
  Owner never at all) and the scenarios assert those refusals directly, so an
  owner/Admin or owner/Reader persona is not an untested case but an
  impossible one.
- **Applications.** They are derived from inventory pushed through `collect`, not
  created through the API, so application scope is covered only with
  nonexistent ids. Pushing an inventory in `provision` would close this.
- **Backup download and alert silences on real objects.** Both need real data
  (an S3 backup, a firing alert); the endpoints are covered, the object-level
  cases are not.
- **The positive impersonation path.** Deliberately: it would leave live sessions
  behind. Only the refusals are asserted.
- **`collect`'s own endpoints.** A separate service with a separate credential
  model (system key/secret over Basic Auth).

## Findings from the full runs

3231 checks, all expectations holding. Details in `authz-report.json`. Findings 2
and 3 below are **fixed**; finding 1 turned out not to be a defect.

### 1. Cross-hierarchy impersonation — INTENDED, spec states it

`POST /api/impersonate` checks the `impersonate:users` permission and the
target's consent but **not** whether the target is inside the caller's
hierarchy: an Owner-organization user reaches any consenting user of any
distributor, reseller or customer — all 200.

That is the design, not a defect. The Owner organization's staff must be able
to support users of every distributor and reseller. The feature therefore has
two barriers, and the hierarchy is deliberately not one of them:

1. the target must have consented;
2. the caller must hold `impersonate:users`, which only the **Staff** and
   **Owner** user roles carry — both confined to the Owner organization (Staff
   is assignable only there, by an Owner-role caller; Owner is never
   assignable at all).

**Barrier 2 is what protects the whole feature**, so that is where the suite
asserts. Verified: a distributor Admin, a reseller Admin, a customer Admin and
a Backoffice user are all refused when promoting a user to Staff *or* creating
one — including when the role id is supplied directly rather than picked from
`GET /roles`, which only hides it. A Staff caller is refused too, both when
assigning Staff outside the Owner organization and when creating users inside
it. Those scenarios live in `scenarios.yml`; the positive impersonation cases
in `special.yml` assert the reach itself, so adding a hierarchy check would
surface as a regression in legitimate support access instead of a silent
change. Containment is structural: no partner user can hold
`impersonate:users`.

This is a good illustration of why expectations here are hand-written: the
suite proves the code allows platform-wide impersonation, and the spec states
whether it should. What the suite could not know, it forced someone to state.

Two real defects did surface alongside it, both still open. Neither is an
authorization hole; both are ways the feature can strand an operator or hide what
is happening.

**a. `DELETE /impersonate` contradicts `/status` on the same token.** Three
endpoints answer "is there a session?" from two different sources:

| Endpoint | Reads from | With the impersonator's own token |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /impersonate/status` | Redis, by impersonator id | sees it: *"currently impersonating"* — **and returns a fresh impersonation token** |
| `POST /impersonate` (409 guard) | Redis, by impersonator id | sees it: *"you already have an active session"* |
| `DELETE /impersonate` (exit) | the **token's** own claims (`is_impersonated`) | does not see it: *400 "not currently impersonating a user"* |

Ending a session therefore takes two calls: `GET /status` to recover an
impersonation token, then `DELETE` with that token. That path is deliberate —
`/status` documents it for the page-reload case — so nobody is ever permanently
stuck. What is wrong is only that the same credential gets contradictory answers
from two endpoints, and nothing at the exit endpoint says the dance is required. A
caller that meets the 400 reasonably concludes there is no session.

The suite closes its own sessions with the token `POST /impersonate` returns, so it
never needs the dance.

Not fixed: the one-call exit was implemented and then reverted on request, since
it touches the impersonation flow that is being reconsidered as a whole.

**b. `GET /impersonate/sessions` answers a different question than its name.**
`GetUserSessions` filters `WHERE impersonated_user_id = $1`, so it returns the
sessions in which the caller **was impersonated** — the target's view. Verified:
the target sees 8 sessions, the Owner-organization user who opened them sees 0, and the audit
table itself is complete and correct. Nothing is lost; the endpoint is simply
named and documented as *"all impersonation sessions for current user"* while
meaning *"sessions where I was the target"*. The consequence is that there is no
way to ask the two questions an operator or an auditor actually has: which
sessions did I open, and who is impersonating whom right now.

### 2. `GET /api/users/:id` did not walk the hierarchy — FAIL-CLOSED, FIXED

A reseller Admin saw the users of its own customers in `GET /api/users` — 11 of
them — but `GET /api/users/:id` on one of those very users answered
`403 "access denied to user"`. `methods/users.go` compared
`targetOrgID == user.OrganizationID` only, while the list uses the
hierarchy-aware `helpers.AppendOrgFilter`: two authorization implementations for
one resource, and the detail one was wrong. The code said as much — *"Additional
logic needed to check customer organizations"*.

Fixed by adding `local.CanReadUser`, the missing member of the
`CanCreateUser`/`CanUpdateUser`/`CanDeleteUser`/`CanSuspendUser` family, and
calling it from `GetUser`. The invariant that made this a bug is now pinned by
`TestLocalUserService_CanReadUserMatchesCanUpdateUser`: whoever may update a user
must be able to read it.

A second defect surfaced in the same block: the "users can always see themselves"
branch compared the `:id` parameter (a **logto_id**) against `user.ID` (the
**local database id**), so it never matched — self-read worked only incidentally,
because the caller is in its own organization. It now compares `LogtoID`, as
`PreventSelfModification` does.

### 3. Rebranding delete handlers mapped every error to one status — FIXED

`DELETE /api/rebranding/:org_id/products/:product_id` answered 500 when there was
simply nothing to delete, which is what the suite caught. The sibling
`DELETE .../:asset` had the mirror defect and the suite could *not* catch it: it
collapsed every error into 404, so a storage failure was reported as "asset not
found" — indistinguishable from a legitimate miss.

Both came from the service returning an untyped `fmt.Errorf` for "no rows
affected". Fixed with sentinel errors (`ErrRebrandingAssetsNotFound`,
`ErrInvalidRebrandingAsset`, following the existing `ErrAPIKey*`/`ErrPromote*`
convention) so the handlers answer 404 for a miss, 400 for an invalid asset name,
and 500 only for real failures — which are now the only case that logs.

### Two design observations, not defects

- **The `Reader` exception lives in Go, not in config.yml.** Organization
  permissions come from the organization's role, so on the declared model every
  Reader of a Distributor organization would hold `manage:resellers`.
  `filterManagePermissionsForReader` subtracts exactly three permission strings
  for exactly one role name. The behaviour is right; its location means a new
  organization-level permission is granted to Readers by default, and a read-only
  role not literally named "Reader" gets full manage rights. See `model.yml`.
- **Logto does not enforce `access_control`.** Portal filtering matched
  `config.yml` exactly for all 23 personas × 4 apps, but that filter is
  visibility, not authorization: a persona the portal hides can still complete
  SSO straight through the app's login URL. Recorded per-app as
  `idp_enforced: false`; flip it the day Logto is made to enforce it and the
  suite will start requiring refusals.

### Known latent issue, not addressed

`isOrganizationInHierarchy` guards `database.DB == nil` on the `owner` branch but
not on the distributor/reseller ones, so with no database those paths nil-deref
rather than denying. Production always has a database, so it is latent; it showed
up because a unit test reached those branches. Left alone deliberately — it is a
robustness fix in a hot authorization path and deserves its own change.

### What held

Everything else. 170 endpoints × 15 matrix personas with no unintended access;
the authentication boundary on all 165 non-public routes; cross-organization
isolation across reads, writes, lists, aggregates, filters, exports, password
resets, system inventory, alert silences, rebranding and VAT existence
disclosure; the `?organization_id=` override, which widens results for the
Owner organization and for nobody else; API keys, capped by both their
read/write mode and their owner's live permissions and refused outright on
session-bound routes; and the Staff/Owner role assignment gate — access_control
plus the role/organization pairing — which is the single thing standing between
a partner admin and platform-wide reach.
