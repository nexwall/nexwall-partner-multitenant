# Backend API

Go REST API server for My Nethesis with Logto JWT authentication and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.24+
- Docker/Podman (for PostgreSQL and Redis)
- Logto instance with M2M app configured

**Note:** The Makefile automatically detects and uses Docker or Podman.

### Setup

```bash
# Setup development environment
make dev-setup

# Start PostgreSQL and Redis containers
make dev-up

# Start the application (initializes database with schema.sql on first run)
make run

# Run database migrations (applies incremental changes on top of base schema)
make db-migrate

# Stop PostgreSQL and Redis when done
make dev-down
```

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# ===========================================
# REQUIRED CONFIGURATION
# ===========================================
# Logto tenant configuration (all other URLs auto-derived)
LOGTO_TENANT_ID=your-tenant-id
LOGTO_TENANT_DOMAIN=your-domain.com

# Logto Management API (from your M2M app)
LOGTO_BACKEND_APP_ID=your-management-api-app-id
LOGTO_BACKEND_APP_SECRET=your-management-api-app-secret

# Token exchange binding: the API resource indicator the SPA requests
# ({API_BASE_URL}/permissions, as pushed by sync) and the SPA's client id.
# /auth/exchange accepts only JWT access tokens bound to both.
LOGTO_API_RESOURCE=https://your-domain.com/api/permissions

DATABASE_URL=postgresql://noc_user:noc_password@localhost:5432/noc?sslmode=disable

# Redis connection URL
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# ===========================================
# BACKUP STORAGE (S3-compatible)
# ===========================================
# Any S3-compatible endpoint works: DigitalOcean Spaces, AWS S3,
# Cloudflare R2, Backblaze B2, self-hosted MinIO / Garage, etc.
# Both backend and collect must point at the SAME bucket; backend
# reads and issues presigned URLs, collect writes uploads from
# appliances. See collect/README.md for the bucket layout.
S3_ENDPOINT=https://ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com
BACKUP_S3_REGION=ams3
BACKUP_S3_BUCKET=my-backups
S3_ACCESS_KEY=your-access-key
S3_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
# Set to "true" only against local emulators that do not serve
# virtual-hosted-style URLs. Spaces / S3 / R2 use the default (false).
BACKUP_S3_USE_PATH_STYLE=false
# Optional: override the endpoint used for signing download URLs so the
# browser can follow them when backend and the S3 emulator are reached
# via different hostnames (compose network vs. host ports). Empty in
# production.
#BACKUP_S3_PRESIGN_ENDPOINT=
# Lifetime of a presigned download URL (capped server-side at 15m).
#BACKUP_PRESIGN_TTL=5m

# ===========================================
# SMTP EMAIL CONFIGURATION (Optional)
# ===========================================
# SMTP server configuration for welcome emails
# If not configured, welcome emails will be skipped (user creation still succeeds)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-app-password
SMTP_FROM=noreply@yourdomain.com
SMTP_FROM_NAME=My Nethesis
SMTP_TLS=true
```

**Auto-derived URLs:**
- `LOGTO_ISSUER` = `https://{LOGTO_TENANT_ID}.logto.app`
- `LOGTO_AUDIENCE` = `https://{LOGTO_TENANT_DOMAIN}/api`
- `JWKS_ENDPOINT` = `https://{LOGTO_TENANT_ID}.logto.app/oidc/jwks`
- `LOGTO_MANAGEMENT_BASE_URL` = `https://{LOGTO_TENANT_ID}.logto.app/api`
- `JWT_ISSUER` = `{LOGTO_TENANT_DOMAIN}`

## Email Configuration

Welcome emails are sent automatically when users are created via API. Email is optional and degrades gracefully if SMTP is not configured.

Configure SMTP in your `.env` (see `.env.example` for all variables):

```bash
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-app-password
SMTP_FROM=noreply@yourdomain.com
SMTP_FROM_NAME=Your Company Name
SMTP_TLS=true
```

Templates are in `services/email/templates/` and support Go template syntax.

## Architecture

### Two-Layer Authorization
1. **Base Authentication**: All routes require valid Logto JWT
2. **Access Control**: Routes check permissions from user roles OR organization roles

### Permission Sources
- **User Roles** (technical capabilities): Admin, Support, Backoffice, Reader in partner organizations; Staff and Owner in the Owner organization only
- **Organization Roles** (business hierarchy): Owner, Distributor, Reseller, Customer — every member of the Owner organization holds the Owner org role (global read/manage on the whole hierarchy plus destroy on distributors/resellers/customers)

Role pairing is enforced fail-closed by the API: inside the Owner organization only Staff is assignable, Staff is never assignable outside it, and the Owner user role is never assignable at all — it belongs solely to the bootstrap `owner` account seeded by `sync init` and is not returned by `GET /api/roles`. Staff holds all non-destructive technical scopes (including `impersonate:users` and `connect:systems`) but no `destroy:systems|users` and cannot manage the Owner organization's own membership; the Owner role adds those.

### User Impersonation
Requires the `impersonate:users` permission, held only by the Staff and Owner user roles: temporarily act as another user with 1-hour scoped JWT tokens. Consent of the target user is mandatory; reach is platform-wide by design. Prevents self-impersonation and token chaining. All actions are logged.

- `POST /api/auth/impersonate` - Start impersonation
- `POST /api/auth/exit-impersonation` - Exit impersonation

### Personal API Keys
Long-lived keys users issue for non-interactive integrations (CRM, ERP) that authenticate without the interactive Logto + 2FA login. Token format `myk_<public>.<secret>`: the public part is stored in clear (indexed for lookup), the secret as a salted SHA-256 hash (same scheme as system tokens). The plaintext is shown once at creation. All regular users, Staff included, get `myk_` keys anchored on their local user id; only the bootstrap `owner` account uses owner keys (`myo_`) anchored on its Logto ID.

A key carries no permissions of its own: on each request the owner's current effective permissions are resolved (10-min Redis cache, no per-request Logto call) and masked to the key's mode — `read` keeps `read:*`, `write` keeps `read:*` + `manage:*`. Destructive/sensitive permissions (`destroy:*`, `impersonate:users`, `config:alerts`) are always excluded. Suspending or deleting the owner disables every key instantly (authoritative DB check); reactivating restores them.

Self-service under `/api/me/api-keys` (interactive session only — a key cannot manage keys, and the group is disabled while impersonating). Creation requires a password step-up. Max 5 active keys per user; TTL default 90d, max 365d. Per-key rate limit (token bucket, 10 req/s, burst 20).

- `POST /api/me/api-keys` - Create a key (returns the plaintext token once)
- `GET /api/me/api-keys` - List own keys (no secrets)
- `DELETE /api/me/api-keys/{id}` - Revoke a key
- `GET /api/me/api-keys/audit` - Own audit trail

**Audit** (`api_key_audit`, append-only): lifecycle (`created`, `revoked`) and security failures (`auth_failed` with reason `revoked`/`expired`/`user_inactive`/`invalid_secret`, plus `rate_limited`). Successful per-request use is tracked via `user_api_keys.last_used_at`, not audited.

### Redis Caching
Multiple cache layers with graceful degradation (system works without Redis):

| Cache | TTL | Keys |
|-------|-----|------|
| Statistics | 10 min | `stats:*` |
| JIT Roles | 5 min | `jit_roles:*` |
| Organization Users | 3 min | `org_users:*` |
| JWKS | 5 min | `jwks:*` |

### Active alerts totals

`/api/alerts/totals` does not fan out to Mimir at request time. The active-alert counts are pre-aggregated per organization into the `alerts_totals_by_org` table by the `AlertsTotalsRefresher` cron in the `collect` service (one Mimir round-trip per tenant, every 60s, bounded concurrency). The endpoint resolves it with a single `SELECT SUM(...) FROM alerts_totals_by_org WHERE organization_id = ANY($1)`, scoped to the caller's hierarchy by `resolveOrgScope`. The `history` count still queries `alert_history` directly (bare `COUNT(*)` for the owner-all path, scoped IN-list otherwise).

When the freshest row in scope is older than 5 minutes (refresher lagging or down), the response carries a `warnings[]` entry like `totals: stale data, oldest refresh Xs ago`; the rest of the payload is still served.

### Test Tokens

Use [apitool](cmd/apitool/README.md) to mint real, hierarchy-aware JWTs by
running the full OIDC + `/auth/exchange` flow and to autonomously create test
orgs, users, and systems.

```bash
# Build the CLI
make apitool

# One-time: provide owner credentials
./apitool init

# Get a fresh JWT for any registered user (or "owner")
TOK=$(./apitool token owner)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOK" http://localhost:8080/api/users
```

Unlike a locally-signed test JWT, the token returned here references a real
org in the database, so RBAC hierarchy checks work end to end. See
[cmd/apitool/README.md](cmd/apitool/README.md) for commands, the registry
format, and a full hierarchy-build example.

See [openapi.yaml](openapi.yaml) for all available endpoints and expected payloads.
